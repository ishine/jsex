# JSex
**JSON Expression Test Library**

This project aims to create a language for building assertions on JSON objects.

It has two main components:

- Lexer and parser to compile an expression into a `JSex` structure.
- Engine to execute `JSex` structures over a JSON object.

This project will use POSIX Regular Expressions Library and [cJSON Library](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON) by Dave Gamble.
